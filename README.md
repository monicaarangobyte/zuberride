# zuberride
In this project, I worked as a data analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago.
Using historical trip data from competitors, I explored passenger preferences, identified key demand patterns, and tested a hypothesis regarding the impact of weather conditions on ride frequency.
The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making related to market strategy and demand forecasting.
### Key Objectives
- Analyze ride-sharing trip patterns in Chicago
- Explore passenger behavior and preferences
- Evaluate the impact of weather on ride frequency
- Test statistical hypotheses using real data
